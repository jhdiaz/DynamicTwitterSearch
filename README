//Title: Dynamic Twitter Search

- Program was tested and implemented on a LAMP stack.
- Created twitter app was used for authorized use of twitter/search API.
- Once search terms are entered, information is passed to server which retrieves results using the twitter API, inserts results into
  a MySQL database, and performs a query based on retweet_count.
- Due to API limitations the result set is not exhaustive, but merely a sample.
- Result set is real-time.

local testing instructions:
	- Extract file into root directory of web server.
	- Start web server.
	- Use "http://localhost/DynamicTwitterSearch/dtsPage.html" as url
